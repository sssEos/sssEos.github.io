<h1>R Package</h1>
<h2>[Outlierfix](https://rdrr.io/github/sssEos/outlierfix/man/fixout_conti.html)</h2>
<p>
The R package has been developed for outlier detection and addressing them appropriately for continuous variables. This process is an integral part of data cleaning and we put together this package to ease that pain for fellow colleagues. The package can be downloaded using the following commands (comments/feedbacks are welcome):

#install.packages(devtools)<br>

library(devtools)<br>

install_github("sssEos/outlierfix")<br>

library(outlierfix)<br>
