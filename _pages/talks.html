R PACKAGE (link)
===============

Outlierfix with Xiaodan Shao 

The R package has been developed for outlier detection and addressing them appropriately for continuous variables. This process is an integral part of data cleaning and we put together this package to ease that pain for fellow colleagues. The package is under review at CRAN and can be downloaded using the following commands (comments/feedback are welcome):

#install.packages(devtools)

library(devtools)

install_github("sssEos/outlierfix")

library(outlierfix)
